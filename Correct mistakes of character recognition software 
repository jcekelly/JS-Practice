// Character recognition software is widely used to digitise printed texts. Thus the texts can be edited, searched and stored on a computer.

// When documents (especially pretty old ones written with a typewriter), are digitised character recognition softwares often make mistakes.

// Your task is correct the errors in the digitised text. You only have to handle the following mistakes:

// S is misinterpreted as 5
// O is misinterpreted as 0
// I is misinterpreted as 1
// The test cases contain numbers only by mistake.

function correct(string) { 
let correctedString = '' // init new string 
for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++){ // loop through the uncorrected string 
  if (string[i] === '5' || '0' || '1'){ // find and access the mistakes in the string 
    correctedString = string.replace(/5/g, 'S').replace(/0/g, 'O').replace (/1/g, 'I') // reaplce mistakes with corrections 
 }
}
   return correctedString
}
correct('51NGAP0RE')

// Futher Optimized solution 

 function correct(string) {
    return string.replace(/0/g, "O")
                 .replace(/5/g, "S")
                 .replace(/1/g, "I");
